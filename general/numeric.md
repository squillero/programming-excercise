# NUMERIC

## Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

Write a function that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor of its parameters.

## Prime numbers

Write a function that checks if its argument is prime.

## Mersenne primes

A Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two. That is, it is a prime number of the form $$M_n = 2^n âˆ’ 1$$ for some integer exponent *n*.

Determine the first 7 exponents $n$ and the resulting Mersenne primes.

> Answer: (2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19) and (3, 7, 31, 127, 8,191, 131,071, 524,287)

## Prime numbers (takes 2)

Write a function that checks if its argument is prime and it can be expressed as sum of two prime numbers.

## Armstrong numbers

An Armstrong number of *N* digits is an integer such that the sum of its digits to the power of *N* is equal to the number itself. For example, 9,474 is an Armstrong number: $$9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 = 9,474$$

Write a program to find the largest Armstrong number below one million.
